    <h3>Complexity Analysis (T(n) y O(n))</h3>
    middle point calculation and half array assignment take a<br>
    time of ~ <span>1+2*(n/2)</span> for each n in each recursive call.<br>
    Merging these two times gives <span>T2(n) =~ 2*n+1</span> Now we recursively<br>
    call over halfs of ns until unity; this type of segmented has<br>
    the following relationship: <span>2^L = N</span> where <span>N</span> is the array<br>
    size and <span>L</span> the number of posible divisions. Then <span>L = lg(N)</span>,<br>
    and this is the number of times we repeat T2(n) for n = N,<br>
    then: <span>T(n) =~ lg(N)*(2*n+1)</span> and<br>
    <h2>The order is <span>&Theta(nlg(n))</span></h2>
